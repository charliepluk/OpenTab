# OpenTab

## Introduction

OpenTab is a point of sale service that allows for customers to order beverages and food at their favorite restaurants. It is comprised of two parts, the mobile application for customers and a web application for restaurant employees. The mobile application side, lets customers create their accounts, be able to connect to local restaurants nearby, and order drinks to their desire, which then can be picked up from the bar. On the web application, the restaurant employees can join the OpenTab service and set up their menu for customers to view. The OpenTab platform was built using React Native, React, NodeJS, SQL, Axios and ExpresJS.
